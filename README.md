1. What is the overall distribution of parking transaction durations?
You can calculate the distribution of parking durations (from the time a vehicle enters to when it exits). This will help you understand the average and most common durations.

2. What is the busiest day of the week for parking?
You can group parking transactions by days of the week and analyze which days have the highest number of transactions.

3. What are the peak hours for parking in the area?
By grouping transactions by time (e.g., hour of the day), you can determine the times during which parking demand is highest.

4. What is the average revenue generated per transaction or per hour?
You can compute the revenue from parking transactions and analyze average revenue per transaction or per time unit (hour, day, etc.).

5. Are there any patterns in parking violations or overstay occurrences?
Analyze transactions where vehicles overstayed their parking duration or where there were violations. You can calculate how often this occurs, the average fine, and the impact on revenue.

6. Which parking spots are most frequently used?
If the dataset includes information about the parking spots (e.g., parking spot ID or location), you can determine which spots have the highest frequency of transactions.

7. How does the parking behavior differ on weekends vs weekdays?
You can compare parking behavior between weekdays and weekends. This could include transaction volume, duration, and revenue analysis.

8. What is the relationship between transaction duration and transaction amount?
You could analyze whether longer parking durations result in higher fees or if there are flat-rate pricing structures.

9. How does parking demand vary by season?
If thereâ€™s date information in the dataset, you can analyze how parking demand fluctuates by season or month, such as identifying any trends during holidays or major events.

10. What is the trend in parking transactions over time (e.g., month-over-month, year-over-year)?
You can perform time-series analysis to observe how parking demand and revenue evolve over time.

11. What percentage of vehicles are long-term parkers vs. short-term parkers?
Based on the parking duration, classify vehicles into long-term and short-term parkers and determine the proportion.

12. Are there differences in parking behavior by parking location or facility (if available in the dataset)?
If the dataset includes parking lot or facility information, you can analyze transaction patterns, usage, and revenue across different locations.

13. Can we predict parking transaction volumes based on the time of day, day of the week, or other factors?
Using machine learning, you can build models to predict parking demand based on factors such as time, weather, day, or location.

14. Is there any correlation between transaction volume and events or holidays?
If event data is available or if the dataset spans over holidays, you can investigate how specific events or holidays impact parking demand.

15. How often do vehicles occupy parking spots for the maximum allowed time?
You can analyze the frequency with which vehicles park for the maximum allowed time and investigate whether this leads to underutilization or overbooking of parking spots.

16. What is the total revenue generated by each parking lot over time?
By grouping transactions by parking lot (if data is available), you can calculate the total revenue generated for each parking lot and identify trends.

17. Are there any anomalies or outliers in parking transactions (e.g., unusually long parking times, incorrect fees)?
Perform anomaly detection to identify any outliers in transaction data, such as unusually long parking durations or transactions with incorrect fees.

18. What is the parking turnover rate (how often do parking spots become available)?
Calculate the turnover rate by tracking the time it takes for a parking spot to be vacated after being occupied.

19. How does parking demand correlate with nearby business hours or events?
If the dataset is linked to business locations, you can analyze how parking demand is influenced by the opening and closing hours of nearby businesses.

Suggested Data Engineering Project Ideas:
Data Pipeline for Parking Transactions:

Build a data pipeline that ingests parking transaction data, cleans the data, and stores it in a database or data warehouse. Use tools like Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion, Apache Spark for data processing, and SQL databases like PostgreSQL or NoSQL solutions like MongoDB for storage.

Real-Time Parking Availability Dashboard:

Create a real-time dashboard that monitors parking transaction data and shows available spots, peak parking times, and revenue generation using tools like Apache Flink or Spark Streaming combined with visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.

Time-Series Forecasting for Parking Demand:

Implement machine learning models to forecast parking demand based on historical transaction data. You could use models like ARIMA, Prophet, or even neural networks like LSTMs for more accurate time-series forecasting.

Building an ETL Process for Parking Data:

Develop an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to gather data from different parking transaction sources (e.g., APIs, CSV files, databases), clean the data, and load it into a data warehouse or analytical database for reporting and analysis.
