# **Traffic Fatality Analysis and Data Pipeline Development using FARS Dataset**

Dataset: [FARS Dataset](https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/)

## **Project Overview:**

This project focuses on the design, development, and deployment of a data engineering pipeline for processing and analyzing the **Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)** dataset. The dataset, maintained by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), provides detailed information on fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States. The primary goal of this project is to create a scalable, automated pipeline that can efficiently ingest, clean, transform, and store this large dataset for further analysis. Additionally, the project will develop a system to generate actionable insights and build a foundation for future traffic safety research and machine learning models.

## **Objectives:**

1. **Data Ingestion**: Design and implement an automated process to ingest the FARS dataset, which is available in CSV format. The process will be scheduled to fetch the most recent data updates from the NHTSA website, ensuring the pipeline remains up-to-date.
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Develop scripts to clean the raw data, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing date and time formats, and transforming the dataset for further analysis.
3. **Data Storage**: Implement a scalable data storage solution, using either relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) or cloud-based storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage), to store the cleaned data in a structured and easily accessible format.
4. **Data Modeling**: Create an optimized data model that can support efficient querying and analysis. This will include establishing relationships between different entities (e.g., crashes, vehicles, drivers) and organizing the data into fact and dimension tables.
5. **Data Analysis & Reporting**: Provide tools and scripts to run analytical queries, such as identifying trends in crash data, the impact of weather conditions on fatal accidents, and high-risk geographical areas. The project will also produce dashboards and reports that summarize insights for decision-makers and stakeholders.
6. **Future Enhancements**: Build a foundation for predictive models to forecast crash occurrences or the likelihood of severe outcomes based on various factors such as weather, time of day, and driver characteristics.

## **Technologies and Tools:**

- **Data Ingestion**: Python (Pandas, Requests), Apache Airflow (for scheduling and automation)
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Apache Spark (for large-scale data processing)
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage
- **Data Modeling**: Relational databases (PostgreSQL), Snowflake schema, Data warehousing techniques
- **Data Analysis & Reporting**: SQL, Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau/Power BI for visualizations
- **Automation & Monitoring**: Apache Airflow, Docker (for containerization), AWS Lambda (for serverless computing)

## **Project Phases:**

### 1. **Phase 1 - Data Ingestion & Initial Setup:**

- Research and gather the FARS dataset from the NHTSA website.
- Implement a script or ETL pipeline to download and ingest the dataset periodically.
- Set up automated data ingestion and ensure that data is consistently updated.

### 2. **Phase 2 - Data Cleaning & Transformation:**

- Handle missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- Standardize date-time formats and clean categorical columns (e.g., crash type, vehicle type).
- Implement logic to categorize the crash severity, injury levels, and road conditions.

### 3. **Phase 3 - Data Storage & Structuring:**

- Design a scalable database schema for the cleaned data.
- Set up a relational database (PostgreSQL) or a cloud-based data lake (S3, BigQuery).
- Populate the database with the transformed data, ensuring optimal indexing and partitioning for fast querying.

### 4. **Phase 4 - Data Analysis & Reporting:**

- Develop SQL queries and Python scripts to explore the dataset and identify key trends (e.g., weather-related accidents, geographic hotspots).
- Implement visualizations and dashboards that provide insights into traffic safety (e.g., crash frequency by time of day, crash severity by region).

### 5. **Phase 5 - Predictive Modeling (Future Enhancement):**

- Explore the use of machine learning models to predict the likelihood of fatalities based on features like weather, time of day, driver characteristics, etc.
- Use libraries like **scikit-learn** or **TensorFlow** to develop predictive models.

## **Project Deliverables:**

1. **Data Pipeline**: A robust, automated data pipeline that can handle the periodic ingestion, transformation, and storage of the FARS dataset.
2. **Database Schema**: A relational database or cloud storage solution with optimized data models, making the data easy to query and analyze.
3. **Insights & Visualizations**: Dashboards and reports that summarize key findings about traffic fatalities, including trends and high-risk areas.
4. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on how the pipeline works, including setup instructions, the data model, and the analysis performed.

## **Potential Impact and Use Cases:**

- **Traffic Safety Improvements**: By analyzing trends in traffic fatalities, policymakers and traffic safety organizations can prioritize areas that need intervention, such as implementing stricter speed limits or better road signage.
- **Insurance Risk Assessment**: Insurance companies can use the data to refine their risk assessment models by considering factors such as road conditions, driver demographics, and crash history.
- **Predictive Models**: Future machine learning models can predict accident severity or the likelihood of fatalities, helping to improve public safety measures, emergency response strategies, and insurance models.

## **Challenges and Considerations:**

- **Data Quality**: Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the dataset, especially when dealing with large and noisy datasets like FARS.
- **Scalability**: Designing the pipeline to handle updates and expansions of the dataset without compromising performance.
- **Data Privacy**: Although the FARS dataset is anonymized, care should be taken when combining it with external datasets to avoid inadvertent exposure of personal information.
